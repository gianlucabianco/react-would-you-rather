# 📖 Assessment instructions and project details


The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## 🔓 Signin / 🔏 Signup / 🔐 Reset password

Users credentials for login are stored in the `credentials.js` file.

Througout the project, the user could reset their password by clicking on the “Forgot Password” link.

The user could also sign up for a new account by clicking on the “Sign Up” link.
The new user will be able to log in after signing up.

## 🗄️ Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### 👥 Users

| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.
