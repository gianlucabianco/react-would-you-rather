# 📖 Assessment instructions and project details


The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## 🗄️ Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### 👥 Users

Users include:

| Attribute    | Type             | Description           |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------         |
| id                 | String           | The user’s unique identifier |
| name          | String           | The user’s first name  and last name     |
| avatarURL  | String           | The path to the image file |
| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.

### ❓ Questions

Questions include:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|

Voting options are attached to questions. They include:

| Attribute | Type | Description |

| votes             | Array | A list that contains the id of each user who voted for that option|
| text                | String | The text of the option |
